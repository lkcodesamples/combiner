# Combiner
   This is a simple project implementing an algorithm which takes as input a number of lists containing objects and generates an output with a number of lists containing the given objects, in such a way that the elements from the input are combined and returned as the output according to the following pattern:
   
   input: [[a1,a2],[b1,b2],[c1,c2]]  
   output: [[a1,b1,c1],[a1,b1,c2],[a1,b2,c1],[a1,b2,c2],[a2,b1,c1],[a2,b1,c2],[a2,b2,c1],[a2,b2,c2]]

   The given input can be of any size and the size of each list in the input can be arbitrary. It is possilbe to limit the result and return only every k-th element from the output.
